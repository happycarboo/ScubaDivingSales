  private readonly PRODUCTS_COLLECTION = 'products';
  private readonly REGULATORS_COLLECTION = 'regulators';
  private readonly BCDS_COLLECTION = 'bcds';
  ```

## Core Backend Components

### 1. Firebase Integration Architecture

The backend is built around Firebase and follows a clean architecture with several components:

- **FirebaseService.ts**: Implements the Façade pattern to provide a simple interface to Firebase
- **IFirebaseService.ts**: Defines the interface for Firebase services (Interface Segregation)
- **firebase.config.ts**: Configuration for Firebase connection
- **ProductRepository.ts**: Implements data access operations for products
- **IProductRepository.ts**: Defines the contract for product operations

**Key Files to Showcase:**
- `src/services/firebase/FirebaseService.ts`
- `src/services/firebase/interfaces/IFirebaseService.ts`
- `src/services/firebase/config/firebase.config.ts`
- `src/services/firebase/repositories/ProductRepository.ts`
- `src/services/firebase/interfaces/IProductRepository.ts`

### 2. Design Pattern Implementation Points

#### Façade Pattern Implementation

The `FirebaseService` class serves as a perfect example of the Façade pattern:

- It encapsulates the Firebase SDK complexity behind a simple interface
- It handles initialization, connection management, and basic operations
- It provides a centralized point of access to Firebase services
- It implements error handling and validation

**Key Files to Showcase:**
- `src/services/firebase/FirebaseService.ts` - Primary implementation of Façade pattern
- `src/patterns/facade/ServiceFacade.ts` - Shows how Firebase Façade integrates with the application

Key talking points:
- How the Façade pattern simplifies Firebase integration for the rest of the application
- How it hides the complex initialization and connection management
- The use of a singleton pattern to ensure a single connection point

```typescript
// Example from FirebaseService.ts
public async initialize(): Promise<void> {
  if (!this.app) {
    try {
      this.app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
      this.db = getFirestore(this.app);
      console.log('Firebase initialized successfully');
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Firebase initialization error:', error);
      throw error;
    }
  }
}
```

#### Factory Method Pattern Integration

The backend integrates with the Factory Method pattern by:

- Using the factory to create product objects from Firebase data
- Converting raw Firestore document data into appropriate Product objects
- Supporting different product types (regulators, BCDs) with consistent interfaces

**Key Files to Showcase:**
- `src/patterns/factory/ProductFactory.ts` - Core Factory Method implementation
- `src/services/firebase/repositories/ProductRepository.ts` - Shows repository using factory to create objects

Key talking points:
- How Firebase data is transformed into domain objects
- How the repository works with the factory to create the right product types
- The evolution of product types as the application grew

### 3. SOLID Principles in Backend Implementation

#### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

The backend demonstrates SRP through:

- **Separation of concerns**: `FirebaseService` handles only Firebase connection
- **Specialized repositories**: `ProductRepository` handles only product data operations
- **Clear boundaries**: Configuration, interfaces, and implementations are separated

**Key Files to Showcase:**
- `src/services/firebase/FirebaseService.ts` - Focused on Firebase connectivity
- `src/services/firebase/repositories/ProductRepository.ts` - Focused on product data operations
- `src/services/firebase/config/firebase.config.ts` - Focused on configuration

Example from ProductRepository.ts:
```typescript
// Single Responsibility Principle: Repository only handles product data operations
export class ProductRepository implements IProductRepository {
  private readonly PRODUCTS_COLLECTION = 'products';
  private readonly REGULATORS_COLLECTION = 'regulators';
  private readonly BCDS_COLLECTION = 'bcds';
  // ...
}
```

#### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

The backend demonstrates OCP through:

- **Interface-based design**: New repository implementations can be added without changing client code
- **Extensible product handling**: Can add new product types without modifying existing code
- **Query flexibility**: Can extend query capabilities without changing core repository code

**Key Files to Showcase:**
- `src/services/firebase/interfaces/IProductRepository.ts` - Interface allowing extension
- `src/services/firebase/interfaces/IFirebaseService.ts` - Interface for service extension

Example from IProductRepository.ts:
```typescript
// Interface allows extending with new methods without breaking existing code
export interface IProductRepository {
  getProduct(id: string): Promise<Product>;
  getAllProducts(): Promise<Product[]>;
  getProductsByType(type: string): Promise<Product[]>;
  // ...
}
```

#### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

The backend demonstrates DIP through:

- **Depending on abstractions**: Components depend on interfaces, not concrete implementations
- **Inversion of control**: High-level modules (services) depend on abstractions that low-level modules (repositories) implement
- **Testability**: Interfaces can be mocked for testing

**Key Files to Showcase:**
- `src/patterns/facade/ServiceFacade.ts` - High-level module depending on abstractions
- `src/services/firebase/repositories/ProductRepository.ts` - Implementation of abstract interface

Example of DIP in action:
```typescript
// ServiceFacade depends on IProductRepository interface, not concrete implementation
private productRepository: IProductRepository;

// This allows swapping implementations without changing the ServiceFacade
```

## Specific Backend Features to Highlight

### 1. Multi-Collection Data Architecture

The backend manages data across multiple collections:

- `products`: Basic product information
- `regulators`: Detailed specifications for regulator products
- `bcds`: Detailed specifications for BCD products

**Key Files to Showcase:**
- `src/services/firebase/repositories/ProductRepository.ts` - Shows multi-collection handling:
  ```typescript
  private readonly PRODUCTS_COLLECTION = 'products';
  private readonly REGULATORS_COLLECTION = 'regulators';
  private readonly BCDS_COLLECTION = 'bcds';
  ```

This architecture demonstrates:
- Domain-driven design principles
- Specialized data handling for different product types
- Flexible data storage strategy

### 2. Error Handling and Resilience

The backend implements comprehensive error handling:

- Try-catch blocks with specific error messages
- Logging for debugging and monitoring
- Fallback strategies when data isn't found

**Key Files to Showcase:**
- `src/services/firebase/FirebaseService.ts` - Connection error handling
- `src/services/firebase/repositories/ProductRepository.ts` - Data operation error handling

### 3. Data Transformation Logic

The repository demonstrates sophisticated data transformation:

- Converting Firestore documents to domain objects
- Handling optional fields with default values
- Supporting different product detail structures

**Key Files to Showcase:**
- `src/services/firebase/repositories/ProductRepository.ts` - Methods like `getProduct()`, `getBCDDetails()`, and `getRegulatorDetails()`

## Conclusion: Backend Architecture Evolution

Chenqian could frame his discussion around how the backend architecture evolved:

1. **Initial Implementation**: Simple Firebase connection with basic product data
2. **Growing Complexity**: Addition of multiple product types with specialized details
3. **Pattern Application**: Implementation of Façade and integration with Factory Method
4. **SOLID Application**: Refactoring to follow SOLID principles

This evolution narrative would effectively demonstrate how software engineering principles were applied to solve real challenges in the development process.
